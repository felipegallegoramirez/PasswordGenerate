# Password Generate

Hi!, this page resulted to the need to generate new secure passwords that need to be memorizable, so, to reinforce my basic knowledge in Python I decided to create my own solution for this.

## Form of use

### Dates

if you open it for the first time, it will not run due to the generation of the first key, which allows that even if a person uses your password on another pc it cannot be used so you will have to click it again.

> this first key is generated in a txt file which is located at the beginning of the folder with the name "data.txt".

### Interface

![Semantic description of image](/misc/interface.png)

1. Name of the website.
2. Your personal password.
3. After filling in the two places above generates the new password for the site.
4. 32-character site password.
5. 16-character site password
   > Note: 4 and 5 are inputs for the user to copy and/or cut for convenience.
